## Platform notes


### All platforms
- Configuration summmaries for each platform and version are present in the release tab
- All modules except QtWebEngine are included, since QtWebEngine cannot be built statically.
- QtMultimedia has no ffmpeg backend

### Linux

- Builds are configured with:
    - Embedded libjpeg, libpng, pcre, zlib
    - System harfuzz and freetype, since they are needed in order to use fontconfig for system fonts
- A fix is applied to QtOpcUa, because it redefined the openssl symbols that were already defined by QtNetwork

### Windows

##### MinGW
- The correct MinGW version must be installed to the system and configured in Qt Creator

##### MSVC

###### X64
- In order to use QtNetwork and QtOpcUa, OpenSSL must be installed. to do so, run 
```
vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows-static-release
```

###### ARM64
- In order to use QtNetwork and QtOpcUa, OpenSSL must be installed. to do so, run 
```
vcpkg install openssl:arm64-windows-static-release
```
